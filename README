Fantastic Micro-Frameworks and Micro-Libraries for Fun and Profit!

How much library code do you really need — 50K? 100K? 150K? More? 
How much of that do you really use? 

Sure, we all love our favorite monolithic frameworks, and sometimes we even
use them fully. But how often do we reach for the ride-on John Deere tractor
with air conditioning and six-speaker sound system, when a judiciously
applied pocketknife would do the trick better, faster, slicker? 

Micro-frameworks are definitely the pocketknives of the JavaScript library
world: short, sweet, to the point. And at 5k and under, micro-frameworks are
very very portable. A micro-framework does one thing and one thing only —
and does it well. No cruft, no featuritis, no feature creep, no excess anywhere. 

Microjs.com helps you discover the most compact-but-powerful microframeworks,
and makes it easy for you to pick one that’ll work for you.
